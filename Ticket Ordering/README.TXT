USER INSTRUCTIONS: When you run this program, you don't need to worry about getting into trouble because
                   of the way that it is designed. First off fill in the information on the first tab for
                   what you want and then click 'Get Tickets!'. After that then click on the second tab
                   and that will display your order of the tickets. You can then choose and see if that is
                   what you wanted of if you want more. You can choose to clear all of the results or 
                   confirm them. Once confirmed, just follow the prompts that come up. Finished. Sweet.
